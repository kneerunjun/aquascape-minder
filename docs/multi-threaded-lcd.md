### Thread safe 16X2 LCD 4 channel mode on Raspberry Pi3B
----

You would often find yourself wrestling around with the connections for an LCD and the Adafruit library [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD). They have distilled the entire setup and personally I feel it cannot be any easier than that. But there is always that odd spot where you find either a blank screen or screen full of just contrasting boxes. Afterall, 4 data, 2 selects, and couple of supply voltages makes it too many connections. (Just bumps up the number of possibilities you may go wrong) Either of the cases , after some effort when you finally get the basic text display on the screen you are hoping that it would be an easy ride ahead of this.

> Mixing threads and the LCD, that is not so fast, can leave you with a LCD with alien characters on the screen. While it can excite some of you, thinking it to be some message from the Decepticons :) , it really is some issue with the underlying threaded applications. Were you wondering how to make your LCD work in n-threaded environment ?

I have illustrated how your software objects could be when you are working with one or more sensors, letting their data display on screens like a 16X2 LCD.In either of the cases you would need a thread safe data object , representing the object model of the solution in entirety. 

#### TSafe Object that implements thread lock :
----

I know most of you Python stalwarts would boo me down when I mention `threading.Lock()` but for the simple case we are talking about , something as raw as 'thread Lock' is sufficient. Moreover I dont want to make this discussion around `threading` in Python. A simple thread locked data object may end up looking like this

```python
class TSafeDashB():
    def __init__(self,*args, **kwargs):
        self._temp = None
        self._light=None
        self._co2=None
        self._co=None
        self._aqi=None
        self._lck  = threading.Lock()
    def put(self,temp=None,light=None,co2=None,co=None,aqi=None):
        self._lck.acquire()
        if temp !=None:
            self._temp=temp
        if light!=None:
            self._light=light
        if co2!=None:
            self._co2=co2
        if co!=None:
            self._co=co
        if aqi!=None:
            self._aqi=aqi   #this comes from the alarm system
        self._lck.release()
        return None
    def temp(self):
        self._lck.acquire()
        result = self._temp
        self._lck.release()
        return result
```

A keen eye can make out that it is a simple ambience sensing project perhaps , a couple of sensors that `put` their value to the `TSafeDashB`. Please note each of the data modification operations under the vigilance of a threading lock. The same TSafeDashB then allows the LCD to fetch values using functions like `temp()`, also not without having acquired the `lock`

#### Sensing and Displaying can be tasks running on co-operative threads :
----

What a novice programmer might prefer is updating the display only after the sensor voltages are read back in and the calculations are done. This renders the LCD a bit patchy , feels like the display has a stammer. The solution here is to get it on a thread (but still co-processed) along with the sensing loop. 

A display update could be more frequent giving it a responsive outlook. Sensing loops ofcourse can have custom intervals at which you would like to measure the physical phenomenon.

Notice,that I mentioned , __co-operative__ , all the threads that I have are evicted out of action on an `threading.Event()` set. Sensing loops enjoy independent threads , but run only till the __event__ is set. So instead of having rogue while loops like these 

```python
while True 
    # do some sensing here
    time.sleep(1.0)

```
I prefer these :

```python

while not killEvent.wait(1.0)
    # do some sensing here 
```
In the prior case , trying to stop the loop from running is much more violent and offers much less of the chance to the hardware to flush. While in the latter, you have to give it some time (atleast equal to the wait time) before the threads come off co-operatively.

```python
killEvent.set()
time.sleep(2.0) # since the sensing loops are 1.0 intervals
GPIO.cleanup()
sys.exit(0)
```

#### n-process instead of n-thread :
---

Python programmers prefer this , I'm aware. Processess are cleaner and have better data marshalling between the simulteneous running tasks. However in the n-process case there is a tradeoff with heat dissipiation (keeping multiple processors busy). RPi is no monster and has meager 4 that can be scheduled. Any more than that would mean you need an aluminium heat sink to ward off the extra heat. If threads weigh on you and it becomes difficult to bend your mind around it, managing the heat from the MCU is certainly much easier.

I had a simple case, locks and events did a good job.

----

- My Raspberry runs python3.5 on Raspbian Jessie
- 16X2 LCD HD44780U , is a green backlight LCD
- I have tested the LCD working for about 48 hours continuously. The above method has not yet scrambled the LCD
- I'm using `threading.Thread` standard threading library
